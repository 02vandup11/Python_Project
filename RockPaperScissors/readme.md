# Rock–Paper–Scissors Game (Python - Jupyter Notebook)

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock–Paper–Scissors game using Python.  
It is created inside a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb), making it easy to understand, run, and modify.  
The project is ideal for beginners learning Python basics, loops, conditionals, user input handling, and simple game logic.
